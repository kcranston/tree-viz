One of the grand challenges in biology is discovery of the detailed pattern of relatedness among life forms, reflecting the process of lineage diversification which formed the magnificent evolutionary tree of life. Computational advances have sparked rapid change in this field, and have also responded rapidly to advances in evolutionary thought. Phylogenetic trees, as the historical conduit of genetic information, have become the central framework for a wide range of key questions in biology, from searching for evolutionary patterns in comparative data, to processes of natural selection, genetic change, and evolutionary rules that apply across divergent forms of life. Computational advances in phylogenetics have enabled the analysis of tree topologies using large data sets (thousands of species and DNA sequences), and advances in tree thinking have catalyzed the development of computational tools for illustrating and visualizing phylogenies. However, software capable of smoothly browsing and visualizing large tree structures, while interfacing with the rapidly growing databases in biodiversity, remain a challenge. This project builds an experienced team of phylogenetic biologists, computational visualization experts from academia and industry, and educators to develop new tools for research and education. This project integrates existing global efforts in biodiversity and evolution to answer large-scale research questions in evolution, build visualization tools that will revolutionize phylogenetic research and design educational tools for experiential learning of the central tenets of evolution, biodiversity, and environmental conservation.
